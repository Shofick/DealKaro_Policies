Refund Policy of DealKaro

This Refund Policy outlines the guidelines for refunds on DealKaro, taking into consideration the sale of our own products, premium subscriptions, and products sold by third-party sellers. Please read this policy carefully before making any purchases or engaging in transactions on our platform.

1. Refund Eligibility for Third-Party Seller Products:
   - Buyers who purchase products from third-party sellers on DealKaro have the option to dispute for a refund under certain circumstances.
   - To initiate a refund request, the buyer must pay a refund processing fee of 10% of the product price, up to a maximum of 100 units of the respective currency.
   - The refund processing fee serves as a deterrent against fraudulent refund claims and ensures that only genuine refund requests are raised.
   - The 10% refund processing fee is 100% refundable if the buyer's claim is proven genuine and the buyer is not attempting to scam or deceive DealKaro.

2. Refund Resolution and Decision:
   - All refund requests and disputes will be handled by the DealKaro customer service team and management.
   - DealKaro holds the final decision-making authority regarding refund resolutions, and both the buyer and the seller must abide by the decision made by DealKaro.
   - DealKaro reserves the right to refund the buyer's payment to the buyer or pay the seller for the product based on the outcome of the dispute resolution process.

3. Refunds for DealKaro's Own Products:
   - Refunds for digital or physical products sold directly by DealKaro may be available under certain circumstances and at the sole discretion of DealKaro.
   - DealKaro reserves the right to determine whether a refund will be provided for its own products.
   - Refunds for premium services, however, are not available and all sales of premium subscriptions are final and non-refundable.

4. Refunds for Digital and Physical Products:
   - Refunds for digital products or goods, including but not limited to software, e-books, or digital downloads, may be considered if the product was not delivered as described or if there are technical errors directly caused by DealKaro.
   - Refunds for physical products will be considered if the product is not delivered to the buyer within the specified time frame or if there are technical errors directly caused by DealKaro that prevent the delivery of the product.

5. Importance of Refund Processing Fee:
   - The refund processing fee of 10% is charged to discourage frivolous refund requests and protect the integrity of the refund system.
   - By charging a refund processing fee, we can focus our efforts on reviewing and resolving genuine refund claims promptly, ensuring a better experience for all users.
   - If a refund request is found to be fraudulent or an attempt to scam DealKaro or the seller, the 10% refund processing fee will not be refunded, and appropriate actions, including account suspension or banning, may be taken.

Please note that this refund policy is subject to change at any time without prior notice. It is the responsibility of all users to review and comply with the most recent version of the policy.
